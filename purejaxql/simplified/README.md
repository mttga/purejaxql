# Jax-Simplified PQN

Simplified PQN implementations. These versions use standard Python loops for better readability and easier experimentation. Only the core computational functions (env step, learning) are jitted for performance. For maximum performance, use the standard purejaxql implementations.

> ⚠ these implementations were not optimized for speed and were tested only on a limited set of environments. To replicate the results from the paper, use the standard purejaxql implementations.
